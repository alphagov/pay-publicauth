Payments Public API Authentication Service

## API Keys

One of the responsibilities of this service is to issue API keys so integrators can request operations through the Public API. An API Key is composed by: Token + HMAC (Token, Signature).

_Tokens_ are randomly generated values and these values are stored in the database (hashed) identifying a single accountID.

pay-publicauth creates an _API key_ by concatinating the token value as plain text with the HMAC signature of the same token using a secret key. The HMAC signature is used to confirm the token was issued by the pay-publicauth service.

## Environment variables
| NAME                  | DESCRIPTION                                                                    |
| ----------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| DB_SSL_OPTION         | To turn TLS on this value must be set as _“ssl=true”_. Otherwise must be empty. |
| TOKEN_DB_BCRYPT_SALT  | Salt used for the hashing algorithm (bcrypt) to hash tokens before being stored in DB. |
| TOKEN_API_HMAC_SECRET | HMAC secret to create the signature for the API Key. |

## Integration tests

To run the integration tests, the `DOCKER_HOST` and `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` environment variables must be set up correctly. On OS X the environment can be set up with:

```
    eval $(boot2docker shellinit)
    eval $(docker-machine env <virtual-machine-name>)

```

The command to run the integration tests is:

```
    mvn test
```
